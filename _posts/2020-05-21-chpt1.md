*It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done. Statesmen despise publicists, painters despise art-critics, and physiologists, physicists, or mathematicians have usually similar feelings: there is no scorn more profound, or on the whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make for the men who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds.*

对于一个职业数学家来说，发现自己在写有关数学界的事让人心生伤感。一个数学家，理应去做些大事，证明新的定理，给数学添砖加瓦，而不是谈论数学界发生了什么。政坛老手鄙视时闻记者，画家反感艺术评论家，而生理学家，物理学家，和数学家，大多有一样的想法：对于一个人嘲讽（试图）解释自己做了什么的人这件事，没有什么东西是又更加合理又更加深入灵魂的。阐述，批判，欣赏是二流选手才干的事情。
