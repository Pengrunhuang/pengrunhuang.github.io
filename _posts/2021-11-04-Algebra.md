The course is taught by [Micheal Zieve](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~zieve/).

I have not been doing well in the course. I am trying to make up the lost notes as much as I can!

Here is the notes for representation theory:
- [Oct. 28, definition](../../../../parts/algebra/1028.pdf) 
- [Nov. 2, irreducible representations, Maschke's theorem](../../../../parts/algebra/1102.pdf)
- [Nov. 4, character, irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis](../../../../parts/algebra/1104.pdf) 
- [Nov. 9](../../../../parts/algebra/1109.pdf)
