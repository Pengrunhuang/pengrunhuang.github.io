title:  Math 389, Winter 2021 Term
categories: Maths
excerpt: Something we did in this interesting course
---
I took Math 389: Exploration in Mathematics at U of M in the 2021 winter semester. During the course we did two projects. One of them is *Gluing the edges of a polygon*, the other being *Attriaction*. I will focus on the first project in this post.

If you want to dive in on your own, here is [the problem construction](../../../../parts/Gluing the Edges of a Polygon.pdf).

So here is the thing: what is a surface?

Intuitively, we just think surface as a '2D' thing, or more often than not, we just accept surface as a natural thing and use is to describe a '2D' thing instead.

Also here is some [results] (https://victorfu14.github.io/parts/gp.html) from the projects.
