I'm Yiwei (YEE-WAY), a student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Michigan.

This is very likely to be a random blog where I wrote some naive stuff to record my studying or amateur research in some field. If you like this blog I would be more than honored.

Alright, we are all naive children in front of the universe of thoughts.
