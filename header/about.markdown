I'm Victor, currently an undergraduate at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Although I'm currently a Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering major, I have vast interest in both arts and sciences, especially in math, physics, and chemistry.

This is very likely to be a random blog where I wrote some naive stuff to record my studying or amateur research in some field. If you like it I would be more than honored.

Alright, we are all naive children in front of the universe of thoughts.
